- 👋 Hi, I’m @charlessands
- 👀 I’m interested in enjoying retirement while learning programming and Kali Linux.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python 3 and Kali Linux through Free Code Camp.
- 💞️ I’m not looking to collaborate on anything yet, at least not until I get going a little bit here. But I already believe I will be using this site quite often.
- 📫 How to reach me: charlessands59@gmail.com.
